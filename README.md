### Federal and State Tax Calculator (only 2 states for testing)
---
The purpose of this application was to better understand how the US tax brackets work.
I learned a lot about how the more money you make the more you traverse through different tax brackets.
My initial, naive, understanding was that a 22% tax rate would be on every dollar made. This is not the case. 

#### Lessons Learned
---
How to slide through the tax brackets and identify when you breached into the next one. While carrying the remainder of funds to the next tax bracket
How to use different data structures and algorithms to effectively solve this issue for various pay ranges and states of residence. 

### Running the app locally
---
Clone the repo to your machine. Make sure that you have python3 installed on your machine. 
Run the `python3 main.py` if you are using linux you may have to run the sudo command beforehand. 
The app is all through the console. The only 2 state options available are "AL" or "TN".
