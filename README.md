## CLI Tax Calculator
---
### Description
---
The purpose of this application was to better understand how the US tax brackets work.
I learned a lot about how the more money you make, the more you traverse through different tax brackets.
My initial, naive understanding was that a 22% tax rate would be on every dollar made. This is not the case. 

### Motivation
---
Like a lot of the projects I build. I wanted a better understanding of how something in the real world worked.
Because I had been using a tax calculator app frequently I figured I should probably just learn how taxes are calculated for my own self-awareness.
This approach ended up being a great thing for me because it helped me understand how federal and state taxes work together and the algorithm that gets someone to their effective tax rate.

### Quick Start
---
Clone the repo to your machine. Make sure that you have python3 installed on your machine. 
Run the `python3 main.py` if you are using linux you may have to run the sudo command beforehand. 
The app is all through the console. The only 2 state options available are "AL" or "TN".

### Usage
